# Smart-Attendance-System
This project automates the attendance-taking process using computer vision techniques implemented with OpenCV. It recognizes faces from a dataset of pre-collected images and logs attendance in real-time, storing the data in a CSV file.
# Features:
  1. Face detection and recognition using OpenCV and face_recognition library.
  2. Real-time attendance logging with timestamps.
  3. Supports both live webcam feed and mobile camera feed.
  4. Simple and easy-to-understand codebase.
# Directory Structure:
- attendance_system.py: Main Python script for face detection, recognition, and attendance logging.
- DATASET/: Folder containing images of individuals for training.
- Attendance.csv: CSV file to store attendance data.
# Dependencies:
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- face_recognition
